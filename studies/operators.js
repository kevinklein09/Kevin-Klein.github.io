/** OPERATORS:
 * 
 * 0: In JavaScript, an operator is a special symbol used to perform operations on operands 
 * (values and variables). It can be said that that an operator operates the operands. There
 * are a number of operators supported by Javascript. 
 * 1: Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic calculations on numbers.
 * 2: Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. 
 * 3: Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean value, either
 * true or false.
 * 4: Logical operators perform logical operations and return a boolean value, either true or 
 * false.
 * 5: Unary operators are special operators that consider a single operand and perform different 
 * types of operations on that single operand.
 * 6: A ternary operator evaluates a condition and executes a block of code based on the 
 * condition.
