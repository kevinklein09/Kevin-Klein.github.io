/**
 * VARIABLES:
 * 
 * 0: Variables are named containers that are used to store data in Javascript. *
 They can be thought of as placeholders that can be accessed later in our program. *
 The data that is stored inside a variable is referred to as the value. There *
 are many data types that can be stored as the value of a variable, such as a *
 String, Number, Boolean, Array, Object, Function, etc. After creating a variable, *
 it is possible to change its assigned value and datatype.
 * 1: In order to create a variable, we must first use the keyword var followed by *
 a unique name(aka an id or alias) that will identify the variable.
 * 2: A variable is capable of undergoing two phases: declaration and initialization *
 (aka assignment).
 * 3: Variables also have the capability to be reassigned to new, completely *
 different values. 
 * 4: There are three total keywords that can be used to declare variables: var, *
 let, and const. Each keyword is different from the other, with its own set of *
 features.  
 * 5: After declaring a variable and executing your code, Javascript undergoes *
  a process that pulls all of the declarations to the top of the code script. This *
  process is called HOISTING.

  // 1. Declaration //
  /* We must use a keyword to first declare our variable, followed by a unique name *
  that represents the intended value or purpose of the variable. If the variable is *
  to be comprised of two words, it is a common practice to type out the variable name *
  in camelCase. This is
